            <h3>About Me.</h3>
            <p> Hi!  I'm Gabby.  Born and raised in Mississippi, I've called
              Nashville home for the past 5 years.  I live here with my husband,
              son, cat and dog.  My full-time job is stay at home mom, but I'm also
              a wedding and lifestyle photographer.

              A few months into stay at home mamahood, I decided I needed to expand
              my skills if I was going to continue to stay home with my son.  Being a
              mama is a job in and of itself, but I also wanted to help provide for my family.

              I stumbled upon HTML and CSS and I was hooked.  I love being able to create,
              but I'm also super analytical and love solving puzzles.  This is what makes
              website development so fun!

              <br><span>Fun fact:</span> I'm an Enneagram type 5w6 which means I'm a natural problem solver.
              Let me help solve yours.</p>

            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>With 10 years of experience, I have learned to capture the true, authentic
              moments.  My goal as a photographer is to capture the essence of who
              my clients are and their story.</p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.
              I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a
              habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

            <img src="img/icon-html.png" alt="html" />
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand
               to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate,
               trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>
